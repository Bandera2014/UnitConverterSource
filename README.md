#MAKE SURE to create your own branch

Take the original version of the unit converter app and add all of the pages from the other students in the course.  
You should have the following pages (10 pts):  
- [ ] space distance
- [ ] mass
- [ ] volume
- [ ] time
- [ ] speed
- [ ] weight
- [ ] frequency
- [ ] temperature
- [ ] bytes
- [ ] home:  and on the home page, you need to welcome the user with a picture and directions of how to use the app.  In the home page, list out what the conversions you can make.  

 (10 pts) Make sure the menu page has the correct titles, your name, and original unit you completed in the menu header.  Change the Android logo as well to something pertaining to units.

 (5 pts) Instead of commenting, Log all calculations and when each method is ran.

Bonus:  Include a history page.  

If a fellow student has not been able to present their portion of the code, create a page for their code, but leave it blank besides stating "this is the _____ unit fragment".
